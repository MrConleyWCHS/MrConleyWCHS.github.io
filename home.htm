		<h2>What is this place?</h2>
		<h3 id="normFont">You, my dear reader, have stumbled upon my website. Who am I? Much like the mysterious enchanter that warned Arthur and his knights of the murderous fluffy bunny, there are some that call me...Tim. I endeavor here to amateurishly depict the media my heart most enjoys and takes comfort in. You will find, to your left, a menu of links that will transport you to various pages containing descriptions, rankings, and multimedia from my favorite books, movies/television shows, and music. If you have accidentally stumbled upon my feeble first attempt at making a website, Welcome! I hope you like the fantasy genre. If you are my IT professor come to grade my assignment, have mercy on me; there's a fiver in it for you.
