    <h3>Best Stand-Alone Book - The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien</h3>
    <p>The adventurous fairie tale of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, helping a dozen dwarves to recapture an ancient, dragon-guarded treasure horde needs no introduction. Originally written to be a childrens' tale, the Hobbit has themes and characters relatable and relevant to people of all ages, which is what makes this book so timeless.</p>

    <p>The big brother to the Hobbit, LOTR as it's lovingly referred to by Tolkienites, is a phenomenon that swept the Western world when it was published in the 50's and again in the early 2000's when the Peter Jackson movies were released. It is easy to say that Tolkien's legendarium is the most impressive feat of world-building ever made.</p>
